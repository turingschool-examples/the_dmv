# The DMV


# 1. I first opened up each file in the directory and started looking over the spec files with the corresponding class files.  After that my process got a little jumbled because i started by looking at the errors in each class individually, which caused difficulties/delays in the debugging process.  I think next time I'd look over each file and see whats similar and different rather than just trying to find where the individual errors might be.  

# 2. It was hard to make sense of the errors on code that wasn't written by myself.  Especially the little bugs like mis-spelling's and incorrect enumerable methods.  When most of the code is correct or looks to be correct i feel that it made me overthink some of the debugging issues, which in turn caused me to spend more time on it.

# 3. I figured the debugging process would be fairly easy for me but i don't think that was the case.  I think if i would have spent more time looking over each file rather than running the spec tests to see errors i would have got through this section a bit quicker.
