# Iteration 1 Reflection:

1. **Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.**
- At first, opening up all the files and looking around I noticed a lot of unfamiliar sytax and other things. I did some googling of operators and methods I hadn’t seen and was happy to be able to find answers to my questions. After that I used `pry` to dig around and look at what information was available in different methods and variables. 
2. **What was hard about working with code you did not write?**
- It took a bit of digging to find errors, but I was able to follow the stack in the error messages to find the sources of the errors.
3. **What was easier than you expected about jumping into an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?**
- Having existing tests to work from made this easy and simple to get started. I just followed the parameters of the test to make them pass. TDD really does help to break things down. It also helped me to see what expected functioning should look like for the code that was already there. There really wasn't any filling in of blanks.
