# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.


Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
* I first ran a test for each file and read the errors. I then read the test to see what they were expecting. I then read the code to see how it was working and why it wasn't passing the test. I then made changes and in between making changes would run the test until everything passed.

What was hard about working with code you did not write?
* The hard part was reading through to figure out what the code was doing and was trying to do.

What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
* It was about how i expected it to be. The well written code along with the test made it easier to figure out what the code is doing.
