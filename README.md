# The DMV

## Reflection

### 1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time

- I started opening each spec file and running it for errors. I did not skip tests at first but then realized that that was helpful to do. I looked up what a spec_helper.rb file was and a faraday jem. I feel that I could grow at this process though, there's plenty that I don't know about these files.

### 2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?

- The hardest part was trying to figure out what the previous developer was trying to accomplish. I thought it made finding errors more difficult but then realized that someone wrote this differently then I would have. It's also easy to overlook simple bug fixes, I automatically think that everything needs a big bug fix. 

### 3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

- Like I mentioned in question #2, it was interesting reading code that I would have not have thought of. I didn't understand all of it so it made things unclear when I started in the middle.
