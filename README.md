# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

#1.Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
  - opened up readme, then gemfiles, researched 'faraday'
  - opened each matching lib and spec file to see how they read. Looked through the spec tests to match instance variables and run pry for testing what variables were responding to and why.
  - researched before(:each) do
  - looked through each file to see how they all interact with each other 
  -  ran each of the spec tests separately and noted errors lines
#2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
  - not knowing how to start or how they all interacted and effected one another
  - also not knowing the "order" of how things stacked. For example, in jungle beat we made nodes then LL then jungle beat. For this project, we don't know how they are all stacked or related to each other. 
#3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
- once I found how things were interacting with eachother, it was easier to start in one class and then go to the next and the next. Also debugging felt a bit easier since going through class today.
