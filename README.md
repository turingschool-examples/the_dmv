# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. The steps I took to dif in to the debuging process were to look at each spec file and start with test 1 and move my way down the list.

2. I don't think there was something that was hard with code I didn't write. Working with data types that I am unfamiliar with is difficult.

3. What made jumping in to an unfamiliar database easier was working on Mod 1's pre-work and having experience jumping in to pre-existing code.
